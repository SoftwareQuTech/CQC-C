CQC-C Documentation
========================

This C library provides a way to program a protocol on a network where the nodes listen to instructions through the classical-quantum combiner (CQC) interface.
For more information on how to use this library with SimulaQron, see https://softwarequtech.github.io/SimulaQron/html/GettingStarted.html.
The documentation for the CQC headers can be found at https://softwarequtech.github.io/CQC-Python/interface.html.
